    "An autoencoder, also known as autoassociator or Diabolo networks, is an artificial neural network employed to recreate the given input.\n",
    "It takes a set of <b>unlabeled</b> inputs, encodes them and then tries to extract the most valuable information from them.\n",
    "They are used for feature extraction, learning generative models of data, dimensionality reduction and can be used for compression. \n",
    "\n",
    "A 2006 paper named <b><a href=\"https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/science.pdf\">Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks</a>, done by G. E. Hinton and R. R. Salakhutdinov</b>, showed better results than years of refining other types of network, and was a breakthrough in the field of Neural Networks, a field that was \"stagnant\" for 10 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, autoencoders, based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, are employed in some of the largest deep learning applications. They are the building blocks of Deep Belief Networks (DBN).\n",

    "<img src=\"https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/r5knpow4bk2farlvxia71e9jp2f2u126.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "But when use this picture we start running into a bottleneck! Because this image being 256x256 pixels in size correspond with an input vector of 65536 dimensions! If we used an image produced with conventional cellphone cameras, that generates images of 4000 x 3000 pixels, we would have 12 million dimensions to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This bottleneck is further problematized as the difficulty of a machine learning problem is increased as more dimensions are involved. According to a 1982 study by C.J. Stone (<a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jizhu/jizhu/wuke/Stone-AoS82.pdf\">link</a>), the time to fit a model, is optimal if:\n",
