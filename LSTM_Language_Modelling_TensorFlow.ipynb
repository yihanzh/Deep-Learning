    "Language Modelling, to put it simply, <b>is the task of assigning probabilities to sequences of words</b>. This means that, given a context of one or a sequence of words in the language the model was trained on, the model should provide the next most probable words or sequence of words that follows from the given sequence of words the sentence. Language Modelling is one of the most important tasks in Natural Language Processing.\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "In this example, one can see the predictions for the next word of a sentence, given the context \"This is an\". As you can see, this boils down to a sequential data analysis task -- you are given a word or a sequence of words (the input data), and, given the context (the state), you need to find out what is the next word (the prediction). This kind of analysis is very important for language-related tasks such as <b>Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Image Captioning, Text Correction</b> and many other very relevant problems. \n",

    "\n",
    "For Language Modelling problems, <b>perplexity</b> is the way to gauge efficiency. Perplexity is simply a measure of how well a probabilistic model is able to predict its sample.

    "<h2>The Penn Treebank dataset</h2>\n",
    "Historically, datasets big enough for Natural Language Processing are hard to come by. This is in part due to the necessity of the sentences to be broken down and tagged with a certain degree of correctness -- or else the models trained on it won't be able to be correct at all.

Basically, we will assign each word a randomly-initialized vector, and input those into the network to be processed. After a number of iterations, these vectors are expected to assume values that help the network to correctly predict what it needs to -- in our case, the probable next word in the sentence.
